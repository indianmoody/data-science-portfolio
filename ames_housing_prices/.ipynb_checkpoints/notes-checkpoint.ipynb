    "1. If categorical variable is extremely non-uniformly distributed. But minority values bring significant change in target variable. What should be done? (Look for 'extremely non-uniform' distribution variables.). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Feature engineering is needed on 'year' variables, e.g. 'YearBuilt' variable. It is not an explicit time series.  \n",

    "    * YearRemodAdd\n",
    "    * GarageYrBlt\n",
    "    * \n",

    "3. MasVnrArea has majority values equal to zero, although reasonably. Should be converted into categorical or dropped. Same issue with BsmtFinSF1, BsmtFinSF2(90% values are 0),   \n",
    "\n",
    "4. BsmtUnfSF: possible categorical variable - basement finished or not.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. BsmtUnfSF/TotalBsmtSF could be a new feature about % of basement unfinished or reverse.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. 2ndFlrSF: more than half values are 0, meaning no second floor. New categorical feature could be created, second floor present or not.  \n",
    "\n",
    "7. LowQualFinSF: almost all values are 0. means only just few houses have some low quality finishing. Can be converted into categorical, if low quality finishing present or not.  \n",

    "8. What to do if a categorical variable doesn't have all categoris in training data. e.g. KitchenQual, BsmtQual, BsmtCond,  \n",

    "9. Functional: extremely non uniform. might be converted into categorical: typical or compromised condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Fireplaces: new categorical feature could be created: fireplace or not.  \n",
    "\n",
    "11. What to do if multiple categorical variables have same category meaning for missing values. e.g. \"NoGarage\" for multiple garage related categorical variables. might create problem in onehot encoding.  \n",
    "\n",
    "12. GarageArea: 81 observations of \"no garage\" has value 0 for area. How to tackle this in this continuous variable?  \n",
