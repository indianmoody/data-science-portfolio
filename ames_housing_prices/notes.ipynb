    "1. If categorical variable is extremely non-uniformly distributed. But minority values bring significant change in target variable. What should be done?\n",
    "2. Feature engineering might be needed on year data, e.g. 'YearBuilt' variable. It is not an explicit time series. \n",
    "3. MasVnrArea has majority values equal to zero, although reasonably. Should be converted into categorical or dropped. Same issue with BsmtFinSF1, BsmtFinSF2(90% values are 0), \n",
    "4. BsmtUnfSF: possible categorical variable - basement finished or not.\n",
    "5. BsmtUnfSF/TotalBsmtSF could be a new feature about % of basement unfinished or reverse.\n",
