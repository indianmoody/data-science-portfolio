## How are IMDB Ratings Related to Movies and Metascore
-----------

1. Have you ever watched or cancelled a movie because of its IMDB rating? 
2. Ever wondered how movie-goers perceive these ratings? Or what triggers them to rate movies on IMDB? 
3. And how IMDB ratings are related to Metascore?

To answer these questions, I have scraped data for top 2500 movies by number of votes.
